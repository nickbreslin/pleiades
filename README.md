#### Modern JavaScript (ES6) Game Engine

This game engine is a hobby project to improve my understanding of ES6 and modern JavaScript development patterns.

### Who is this for?

If you're interested in learning the fundementals of modern JavaScript app development (ES6, webpack), without the overhead of learning specific frameworks, this game engine is for you.

### Why not a real framework?

This project serves as a stepping stone of a migration from legacy web development (jQuery, ES5) along my path to adopt a more robust, modern framework (React, Vue). I'm a strong believer in understanding why features in frameworks should exist. What problems are these frameworks solving?

You can and should be hungry to learn and improve your skills and understanding. Ask questions and challenge the status quo.

### What type of games can I use this for?

This engine is specific for [incremental, browser games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game).

* Accrue turns or energy over time
* Short play sessions
* Long term goals and investments
* Character/Kingdom management.


## Feature Highlights & Roadmap

### Ludum Dare compliance

I'd like to participate in game jams, hackathons and competitions with this engine.

### No multiplayer

Let's Keep It Simple, Stupid.

There will be a time and place for multiplayer, but this engine is not for those ambitious goals.


### Product Milestones

These are the platforms I hope to publish too. Part of understanding the toolchain of modern JavaScript also includes how to take your game to market, and the nuance of each platform. 

* Amazon Web Services
* Kongregate
* Mobile (Apache Cordova)
* Steam (NW.js)
